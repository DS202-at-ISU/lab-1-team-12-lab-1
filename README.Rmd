## Overview
This lab involves learning and practicing version control using Git and GitHub through RStudio. The key objectives are:
- Setting up GitHub Classroom
- Cloning a repository
- Committing and pushing changes
- Resolving errors and documenting the process

## Steps Followed

### 1. Getting Started
- Identified team members and formed a group.
- Accessed the instructions via Canvas and the provided GitHub link.

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup
- Accepted the GitHub Classroom invitation and logged in.
- Verified whether our team number existed; found and joined our team (Team-12).

### 3. Connecting RStudio to GitHub
- Ensured prerequisites were met (Git installed, RStudio configured, GitHub account created).
- Created a new repository on GitHub and cloned it to our local machine using RStudio.

### 4. Making Changes Locally
- Opened `README.md` in RStudio.
- Added a line: "This is a line from RStudio."
- Staged and committed the change with the message: "Commit from RStudio by Ash Bhuiyan."

### 5. Pushing Changes to GitHub
- Used RStudio’s Git panel to push changes to the remote repository.
- Verified the update by checking GitHub’s commit history.

### 6. Handling Errors

## Conclusion
This lab successfully introduced Git and GitHub through RStudio. We learned how to:
- Set up and use Git within RStudio.
- Collaborate effectively using GitHub Classroom.
- Troubleshoot common Git errors.

## Submission
